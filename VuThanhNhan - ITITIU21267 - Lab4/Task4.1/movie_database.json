It was a Christmas-themed compilation of animated shorts featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck combined with excerpts from Disney feature films, made as a result of Disney being forced to delay the original premiere of Mickey's Christmas Carol due to an animator's strike. The opening and closing numbers, featuring the song \"On Christmas Morning\", showcased Christmas at Disneyland. The special was nominated for the 1984 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour); however, it lost to Garfield on the Town. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the original full-length and shortened versions of the special were rebroadcast on CBS and the Disney Channel.",

And though Bob has a friendly attitude to his miserly boss, he is not duly rewarded for his work and his family doesn't have enough food to go around. Scrooge can't be bothered with other people's misery. That is, until he is visited by three ghosts, who show him the effects of his miserly ways. The other shorts are also related to Christmas, the most religous of which is called \"The Small One,\" which ends with a starlit cross lighting the sky on the eve of Jesus' birth",

When Raka (Barkha Sengupta), a hot, 20-something, gun-toting coal-mafia’s amorous advents are rejected by college-goer Akash (Om), she turns his life into a living hell. So, Akash, along with his family, flees Ranigunj in order to escape Raka’s wrath and joins a college in Kolkata under the alias of Rohit Roy. Here, he meets Rini (Megha Chakraborty) and romance blooms. But is Raka ready to let go off Akash so soon?",
